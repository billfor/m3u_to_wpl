Convert a .m3u with unicode into a .wpl format that will play on Sonos.

Files should be in a path similar to your scanned media library, for example:

            \\192.168.1.62\Music\Indie\Cœur De Pirate - Trauma - 02 - Heartbeats Accelerating.mp3

After converting just copy it someplace in your music library, and navigate to it.
